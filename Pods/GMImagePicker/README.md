## Usage

#### Installation

###### Using CocoaPods
```ruby
pod 'GMImagePicker', '~> 0.0.1'
```

If you don't know yet what CocoaPods is, you should ASAP. It is the standard dependency manager for iOS projects. You can read a good tutorial by [Ray Wenderlich here](http://www.raywenderlich.com/64546/introduction-to-cocoapods-2) 

###### Manually 
Download and import GMImagePicker folder into your project.

#### Import header file

```` objective-c
#import "GMImagePickerController.h"
````
#### Initialize the picker, set the delegate and present it.

```` objective-c
	GMImagePickerController *picker = [[GMImagePickerController alloc] init];
    picker.delegate = self;
    [self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];
````

#### Delegate
Implement the `GMImagePickerControllerDelegate` protocol in your class 

```` objective-c
@interface YourViewController : UIViewController <GMImagePickerControllerDelegate>
````
Implement the `didFinishPickingAssets` delegate method. Note you are responsible for dismissing the picker when the operation completes and process the returned `(NSArray *)assetArray` :

```` objective-c
- (void)assetsPickerController:(GMImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingAssets:(NSArray *)assetArray
{
    [picker.presentingViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    NSLog(@"GMImagePicker: User ended picking assets. Number of selected items is: %lu", (unsigned long)assetArray.count);
}
````

You can also implement optional `assetsPickerControllerDidCancel` 
```` objective-c
-(void)assetsPickerControllerDidCancel:(GMImagePickerController *)picker
{
    NSLog(@"GMImagePicker: User pressed cancel button");
}
````



#### Customization
Before presenting the picker, you can customize some of its properties
```` objective-c
    ...
    //Display or not the selection info Toolbar:
    picker.displaySelectionInfoToolbar = YES;

    //Display or not the number of assets in each album:
    picker.displayAlbumsNumberOfAssets = YES;
   
    //Customize the picker title and prompt (helper message over the title)
    picker.title = @"Custom title";
    picker.customNavigationBarPrompt = @"Custom helper message!";

    //Customize the number of cols depending on orientation and the inter-item spacing
    picker.colsInPortrait = 3;
    picker.colsInLandscape = 5;
    picker.minimumInteritemSpacing = 2.0;

    //You can pick the smart collections you want to show:
    _customSmartCollections = @[@(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumFavorites),
                                @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumRecentlyAdded),
                                @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumVideos),
                                @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumSlomoVideos),
                                @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumTimelapses),
                                @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumBursts),
                                @(PHAssetCollectionSubtypeSmartAlbumPanoramas)];
    ...
````

    ...
    GMImagePickerController *picker = [[GMImagePickerController alloc] init];
    picker.delegate = self;
    
    picker.title = @"Custom title";
    picker.customNavigationBarPrompt = @"Custom helper message!";
    picker.colsInPortrait = 3;
    picker.colsInLandscape = 5;
    picker.minimumInteritemSpacing = 2.0;
    picker.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationPopover;
    
    UIPopoverPresentationController *popPC = picker.popoverPresentationController;
    popPC.permittedArrowDirections = UIPopoverArrowDirectionAny;
    popPC.sourceView = _gmImagePickerButton;
    popPC.sourceRect = _gmImagePickerButton.bounds;
